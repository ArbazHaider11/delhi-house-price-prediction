### ðŸ“Š Model Comparison

To determine the most suitable algorithm for this regression task, multiple models were trained and evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The comparison is as follows:

| Model              | Mean RMSE |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Linear Regression | 163.80    |
| Decision Tree     | 148.47    |
| Random Forest     | 107.14    |

âœ… **Random Forest** was chosen as the final model due to its significantly better performance in terms of prediction error.
